# FiveM - nui_devblock
FiveM - Inspector block

What it is?

Blocker for Chrome Inspector aka nui_devtools in FiveM

- The javascript code isn't written by me, i just re-written it to FiveM Lua and connected it with server-side to kick the player who enable it.

- U can use a webhook to see who used it

- Don't change the name of the script.


~ It still experimental, there might be some bugs.
